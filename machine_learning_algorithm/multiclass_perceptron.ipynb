    "The training with learning rate = 0.09 has more significant fluctuation than learning rate = 0.01. It is because the training process with larger learning rate causes overshooting easier. So, when the learning rate is 0.09, the training process is not stable compared with the model with learning rate = 0.01 .\n",
    "\n",
    "With the learning rate decay, the model training process can train the weights with decreasing learning rate which is beneficial for the overshotting problem. As for the speed of training, the number of mini-batches of training model of learning rate = 0.1 to stable situation is fewer than the model with learning rate = 0.09, which means the learning rate = 0.1 is faster than learning rate = 0.9 .\n",
    "\n",
    "In the end of the models training, both of them are keeping stable, but the test errors are not at 0. It is because the training error has been 0, so there is no gradient to train the weights, leading to a stable situation in the end of training. The distribution of train and test data is not totally same, so it not means the best model for training data is also the best for test data.\n"
