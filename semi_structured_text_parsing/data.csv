The at least one medium of claim 14, wherein the first and second configuration files include differing configurations for the first and second remote computing nodes based on the first remote computing node employing a first graphical user interface and the second remote computing nodes employing a second graphical user interface.16. At least one non-transitory machine-readable medium having stored thereon data which, if used by at least one machine, causes the at least one machine to perform operations comprising:in response to communicating a first request for first video content and a first video player to a first remote computing node, receiving from the first remote computing node: (a)(i) first source code for the first video player, (a)(ii) a first configuration file for the first video player, and (a)(iii) a first player module corresponding to the first video player; andin response to receiving the first player module, subscribing the first player module to a first event bus of a publication-subscription messaging system;wherein the first video player comprises data which, if used by the at least one machine, causes the at least one machine to play video via a graphical user interface;wherein the first player module comprises data which, if used by the at least one machine, causes the at least one machine to perform a first routine in response to: (b)(i) a first publication to the first event bus from an additional player module that corresponds to the first video player, and (b)(ii) execution of a first callback function corresponding to the first publication.17. The at least one medium of claim 16:wherein the operations comprise (a)(i) obtaining second and third player modules corresponding to the first video player, (a)(ii) subscribing the second and third player modules to the first event bus, and (a)(iii) publishing second metadata to the first event bus via the second player module;wherein the second metadata concerns at least one of: video-playback resolution for the first remote computing node or transcode format for the first remote computing node.18. The at least one medium of claim 17 wherein the operations comprise causing the third player module to load a fourth player module corresponding to the first video player in response to the second player publishing the second metadata and the third player module subscribing to the second metadata.19. A computing system comprising:means for receiving a first request for first video content and a first video player from a first remote computing node;means for, in response to receiving the first request, (a)(i) obtaining first source code for the first video player, (a)(ii) obtaining a first configuration file for the first video player, (a)(iii) obtaining a first player module corresponding to the first video player, and (a)(iv) communicating the first video content, the first source code, the first configuration file, and the first player module to the first remote computing node;wherein the first video player comprises means for playing video via a graphical user interface;wherein the first player module comprises means for performing a first routine in response to (b)(i) the first player module subscribing to a first event bus of a publication-subscription messaging system, (b)(ii) a first publication to the first event bus from an additional player module that corresponds to the first video player, and (b)(iii) execution of a first callback function corresponding to the first publication.20. The system of claim 19 comprising:means for, in response to receiving the first request, (a)(i) obtaining second and third player modules corresponding to the first video player, and (a)(ii) communicating the second and third player modules to the first remote computing node;wherein, in response to the second player module being subscribed to the first event bus, the second player is configured to publish second metadata to the first event bus;means for, in response to the third player subscribing to the first event bus and the second player publishing the second metadata, (a)(i) obtaining a fourth player module, but not a fifth player module, from a group of player modules that include the fourth and fifth player modules and that all correspond the first video, and (a)(ii) and communicating the fourth player module, but not the fifth player module, to the first remote computing node.]","An embodiment includes receiving a first request for first video content and a first video player from a client; in response (a) (i) obtaining first source code for the first video player, (a)(ii) obtaining a first configuration file for the first video player, (a)(iii) obtaining a first player module corresponding to the first video player, and (a)(iv) communicating same to the client. The first video player comprises code to play video via a graphical user interface.
